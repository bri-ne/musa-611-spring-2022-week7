# Surveillance 

[Guiding Article](https://surveillance.thelensnola.org/)

This map will tell the political story of surveillance cameras in New Orleans, who is in favor of them, whether they live in area inundated with surveillance tech, and whether they benefit from it.

**Motivation**

Good ordinace passed, but ...
" However, The Lens’ recent report along with continued statements from city officials looking to alter the ordinance is a stark reminder that the movement against mass surveillance in New Orleans and across the South has only just begun. "

(oridnance 33021, passed dec 2020)[https://twitter.com/EOS_NOLA/status/1340050066342637568]

**The problem**
"They also continue to distract from addressing the root causes of crime; these tools don’t prevent crime, yet we continue to pour money into them instead of affordable housing, job training, nutritious food options, and better schools"
- data fusion" like smart cities having more data to link togethre including habitual travel and behavior patterns from law enforcemnt viode surveillecen 

**Questions to Answer**

- where those city officials are? if their elected what their districts are or where they live?
- or like education spending on those same blockgroups 
- do surveillance cameras lower crime?
  - not really in the USA, not really in Residential areas or city centers (yes in transit stops and parking lots)
  - and even if they don't prevent crime they are used to strengthen cases to send people to jail, which is the current solution at the ceenter of debates about community health and safety [https://surveillance.thelensnola.org/safety/](link)

**Data Sources**
- survelliance camera locations
- census demographics by block groups
- education spending or other public good spending (Community Assets)

## Players

### Jason Williams
*Former City council (supporting legislation pform eye on surveillance?) 
current DA*
- 2020, put forth [Ordinance 33021](https://cityofno.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=&event_id=23024&meta_id=490091)
  - was delayed several times
  - but eventually passed in dec. 2020, after being severly watered down
    - "The original ordinance would have created comprehensive approval processes, oversight protocols and regular reporting requirements for every part of the city’s sprawling surveillance system. Those were removed from the final version." 
  - banned facial recognition, characteristic recognition and tracking software, predictive policing and cell-site simulators. 
  - defines "surveillance tech" for the first time  
    - "“any software or system capable of tracking people and/or objects based on characteristics such as color, size, shape, age, eight, speed, path, clothing, accessories, vehicle make or model, or any other trait that can be used for tracking purposes, including BriefCam and similar software.”
  - [lense article](https://thelensnola.org/2020/12/18/new-orleans-city-council-approves-ban-on-facial-recognition-predictive-policing-and-other-surveillance-tech/)
- Said this during the meeting when the ordinace was passed: 
"Agree with councilmember Palmer that it  can be revisted after policies are put in place or if [the tech] was proved to not be flawed"
- brosset is the only one that voted NAY
- pro surveillance, but also concerned about regulation around it. complex figure
  
  "“There's a ton of technology I plan on using to prove cases over here at the DA's office,” he told The Lens. “If someone is using a weapon on city streets and it's picked up on a camera and I can access that camera, I'm going to use that as evidence.”"

  "As a council member, he praised the city's 2017 surveillance expansion efforts, and specifically encouraged a controversial, and ultimately abandoned, plan to install infrared cameras that could see through people’s clothes to virtually check for weapons."

  "Some of my liberal friends may say this is an infringement upon constitutional rights, but at the end of the day, what is more important than the safety of this community?” Williams said in 2017.   

  ...

  “People want the latest and greatest thing, but we're not educating ourselves on the negative ramifications of some of this technology,” he said.

  In 2020, after he announced his run for DA, Williams began working with Eye on Surveillance to create a law setting restrictions and oversight measures for surveillance, only some of which were ultimately approved by the City Council.

  “We gotta get in front of it,” Williams said. “Even if it's not here yet, we need to start having conversations about the best way to use these things and what we don’t want them to do ever.”

 - proejcted to run for mayor


### NOPD & it's leadership
-"In November 2020, the NOPD admitted that detectives had been using facial recognition since at least 2018. The department justified its previous denials by arguing that the city didn’t own the software itself. Instead, NOPD investigators were accessing it through the Louisiana State Analytics and Fusion Exchange — one of 82 “fusion centers” across all 50 states that make up a vast, federally funded intelligence and data sharing network."

### Mayor Landrieu
- wanted to put a camera at every liquor store,asked city ocuncil to propose ordinance but due to poltiical pressue had to ask them to withdraw it [link](https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_dd449cca-8259-5416-bbc4-5bf83d08d967.html)

"In 2018, an article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd) shocked many New Orleans residents when it revealed that the NOPD had quietly obtained an advanced analytic software — called Gotham — and used it to create a database listing the one percent of New Orleans residents with the highest perceived threat of committing a gun crime.

The software was made by Palantir — a data-mining company founded by billionaire Peter Thiel with early investment from the CIA’s venture capital branch. The NOPD had been using the software for six years by the time the practice was exposed by The Verge, which characterized it as a “predictive policing system.”

Starting in 2012, under former Mayor Mitch Landrieu, the city used Palantir’s Gotham software to identify and round up hundreds of potential gang-members for public safety “interventions” at the criminal court building, where they were informed that they and their friends were being closely watched and could face enhanced prosecution for future crimes.

"We know who you are. We know who your friends are. We know where you go. We know everything about you," Landrieu said after the first “intervention” in 2012."

### Mayor Cantrell
Over the past year, Cantrell’s office denied multiple interview requests for this project and ignored many of The Lens’ emailed questions regarding the city’s use, oversight of and investment in surveillance technology. The city also provided incomplete and inaccurate records in response to some of The Lens’ public records requests.

- feb 2020 prposoal for 146 traffic light cameras that record video and audio detection, weather monitoring (proposed by Williams on behalf of Cantrell), this comes before striking out ban/limit/somethign on traffic cameras in ordinance 33021 proposed by williams  in dec 2020. footage would be made availabel to RTCC [link](https://thelensnola.org/2020/02/19/citys-new-smart-city-pilot-proposal-would-add-90-new-public-cameras-using-entergy-funds/) 
  - **but put on hold until the 33021**
  - "In a somewhat surprising turn, then-Councilman Williams decided to put the smart cities pilot on hold until the council could pass comprehensive surveillance regulation similar to CCOPS legislation in other cities. He said that the decision was heavily influenced by the work of Eye on Surveillance advocates."
  -  The only explanation given during the meeting was simply that the NOPD had asked them to remove those pieces of the law.

    “We've stripped extensive approval and reporting processes as requested by the NOPD,” Williams said during a December council meeting.

  - “The technology is only a tool,” he told The Lens. “It doesn't mean that anyone's rights are being violated. It doesn’t mean the police are engaging in anything covert or constitutionally invalid."
  - "And already, the NOPD is working to walk back at least the facial recognition ban. Councilman **Jay Banks** told The Lens that the NOPD was working on a policy on how it would use facial recognition and that he would support reversing the ban if the policy was sound." **but Banks lost election,district B**



### RTCC 
The RTCC is not controlled directly by the New Orleans Police Department. It’s managed by the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. It runs surveillance operations on behalf of the NOPD, but it works with other law enforcement agencies as well, including the FBI, the Louisiana State Police, Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, university police departments, and more.

- As of February 2021, the Real Time Crime Center monitored live feeds from 555 city-owned cameras and 420 integrated privately owned cameras.

The 555 city-owned cameras are marked with NOPD logos and sometimes have red and blue flashing lights. These cameras are mostly static, but the city can and does move them around intermittently.

City Council members, for their part, had every reason to believe the technology wasn’t being used. At a July 2020 hearing, council members asked the city’s Chief Technology Officer and the administrator of the Real Time Crime Center whether the city was using facial recognition. And repeatedly, those officials assured them it was not.

“Of course the city doesn’t deploy any facial recognition technology in a law enforcement purpose,” RTCC administrator Ross Bourgeois told the council. “The city doesn’t have any of that technology available for our use.”

Just a few months later, when it was revealed that wasn't true, NOPD Superintendent Shaun Ferguson told the City Council that he was just as surprised as they were.

### Jeff Burkhardt
**real world harm**
"In New Orleans in 2018, police officers saw two crime cameras with NOPD logos installed on a public utility pole. But they weren’t owned by the city. A neighbor told the police the camera was privately owned by Jeff Burkhardt — the vice president of the city’s primary surveillance camera contractor, Active Solutions."

Burkhardt used to own the house closest to the camera, before his wife took control of it the year prior in a separation of property agreement, according to court records. The day after The Lens contacted Burkhardt about the camera, it was gone. But the city never explained what the camera was doing there."


## Other Quotes

re the map: 
"Even getting basic information about the city’s surveillance arsenal can be an exhausting exercise. The city, for example, refused to release a map of its surveillance cameras for years until it was sued by an attorney from the Orleans Public Defenders Office with representation by the ACLU."


“The fact that we had to sue to get a map of publicly visible cameras I think just illustrates the kind of ridiculousness of the city claiming it has any type of transparency when it comes to surveillance,” Hamilton said. [lense](https://surveillance.thelensnola.org/)

[the map]( https://www.nola.gov/homeland-security/real-time-crime-center/#cameras)

"As of January 2021, the city had access to live video footage from 975 cameras. The city only directly owns 555 cameras, which are plotted on the map below.
=- The other 420 live video feeds come through a program called Safecam Platinum, which allows private residents and businesses to hook up their cameras to the city system." 

re 33021:
“The problem there is you've intervened effectively on four kinds of surveillance technology, and everything else is left untouched,” Rosenberg said. “And for the moment, that probably has some efficacy. But as time moves on and technology marches on, there will be new things down the road that potentially are just as disturbing as those you chose to ban."

Advocates also point out that without those oversight measures, there’s no sure way to verify whether those bans are even being followed, considering that the city falsely claimed it wasn't using facial recognition for years.
